.. rubric:: Footnotes


.. [#f1] PyMuPDF generally only supports Python versions that are still maintained by the Python Software Foundation. Once a Python version is being retired, PyMuPDF support will also be ended. This means that wheels for a retired Python platform will no longer be provided, and that Python language features may be used that did not exist in the retired Python version.
